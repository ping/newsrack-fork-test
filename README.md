# newsrack-fork-test

Demo [newsrack](https://github.com/ping/newsrack/) fork repository.

Because you cannot fork your own repository on GitHub, this is a copy with the [`main`](https://github.com/ping/newsrack-fork-test/tree/main) branch synced manually from [source](https://github.com/ping/newsrack/tree/main).

The customisations shown here should also work on an actual fork.

## Summary of Changes

- Enable Pages in Repository settings to deploy from `GitHub Actions`
- Default branch changed to new [`custom`](https://github.com/ping/newsrack-fork-test/tree/custom) branch
- [Customise recipes and cron schedule](https://github.com/ping/newsrack-fork-test/compare/main...custom)
